# RSTunnel
A continuation of Reliable SSH Tunnel

RSTunnel (Reliable SSH Tunnel) maintains a secure tunnel between two hosts.

## Why a new project?

`autossh` will probably meet your needs just fine. One drawback is that it requires you to compile a binary for non-standard platforms. Things like WiFi access points, IP cameras, etc.

The goal of this continuation of RSTunnel is to require nothing more than a shell, even a simplistic one like `ash`.
