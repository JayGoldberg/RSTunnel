 RSTUNNEL (Reliable SSH Tunnel)
+==============================+


 OVERVIEW
+--------+

This is mainly intended for people who want/have a secure tunnel from one
host to another. If you want to do any port fowarding from one network to 
another in a secure fashion this program can be very benefical.  

For example, let's say you have an internal webserver in your office place 
and you're at home and you wanted to see it from your house.  You could use 
ssh to do port forwarding from your webserver at work to your computer at 
home.  Your ssh config file would look like this "LocalForward 5000 10.0.0.254:80".
"5000" is the port that is going to be listening on the local machine where
you're running the program.  "10.0.0.254" is the IP of the internal host of 
the network you're connecting to, and "80" is the port of the remote server 
that you want to forward to your network.  This is just one example of many
on how you can use rstunnel.  

Now the beauty thing about rstunnel is that let's say the tunnel goes down
(Trust me the tunnel goes down often  when transfer a lot of traffic through
it, or when the net connection is slow ) it will make sure that the tunnel 
is running and actually passing data through properly.

It is recommended that you run rstunnel in a cron job like this.
"1,30 * * * * /usr/local/bin/rstunnel"

This will check twice an hour to see if the tunnel is running. 

** NOW AVAILABLE **
rstunneld:  Which will get rid of the cron use, and run rstunnel for you.
Right now if you want to edit any of the settings, just edit rstunneld directly.
To run it, just type "./rstunneld &".


 REQUIRED SOFTWARE
+-----------------+

In order for rstunnel to work properly, you'll need "bash", "ssh", and "blow".
The only special binary that you'll need is "blow". "blow" source is now 
packaged with rstunnel, so when you run rstunnel for the first time, it will
install it for you.  "blow" will work with SunOS, Linux, and FreeBSD. I haven't
tested any other platform.  If you want to install "blow" manually you can 
grab it from here;
"http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/pds.cgi?ports/net/suckblow"

 INSTALL
+-------+

The installation is pretty easy, just run "install.sh", and it will guide 
you through what needs to be configured.  After running the "install.sh" 
script, and you want to do minor adjustments, just edit the "rstunnel.conf" 
file.  This file will only exist after you have run the "install.sh" script.
Once you finish with "install.sh", just run rstunnel and if there is any 
other adjustments, rstunnel will guide you through them.
